    <p>I adapted this recipe from a book called
        <i>Sydney Food</i> by Biil Grainger.Ever since
        tasting these eggs on my 1<sup>st</sup> visit 
        to Bill's restaurant in Kings Cross, Sydney. I have 
        been after the recipe <br> believe are the 
        <i>best</i>scrambled eggs I have ever tasted <br><br>
        This recipe is what I call a "very special breakfast" ;
        just look at the ingredients to see why. It has to be
        tasted to be belived.
